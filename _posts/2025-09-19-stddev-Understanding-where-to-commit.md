 📊 Standard Deviation in Capacity Management and Forecasting

When we talk about optimizing systems like **BigQuery slots** or predicting trends such as **gold prices**, one concept keeps surfacing: **Standard Deviation**.  

It may look like just another statistical term, but in practice, it’s one of the most powerful ways to understand how dense the data is.

## What is Standard Deviation?

At its core, **standard deviation (σ)** measures how much individual data points vary from the mean (average).  

- If your data points are tightly clustered around the mean → **low standard deviation**.  
- If your data points are widely spread → **high standard deviation**.  

It answers: *“How stable or volatile is my system?”*

## Why I Used It in BigQuery Capacity Management

In BigQuery capacity planning, we don’t want to just look at the **average slot usage**. Averages can lie.  

**Example:**  
- A project uses **500 slots most of the time**, but occasionally spikes to **1,000 slots**.  
- The average shows **600 slots**.  
- If you set baseline = 600, you’ll **waste 100 slots** most of the time, and still hit **autoscale bursts** on spikes.  

👉 This is where **standard deviation** comes in.  

By looking at **mean ± standard deviation**, I could:  
- Detect **idle slots** (usage consistently below baseline).  
- Detect **bursts** (usage shooting well above baseline).  
- Quantify **variability**: how predictable or unpredictable the workload is.  

This gave me confidence to recommend **baseline slots** not just on mean, but on **mean±σ**
- **Conservative planning** → baseline closer to mean + 2σ (covers ~95% of usage).  
- **Cost-saving planning** → baseline closer to mean + 1σ (covers ~68%, accepts some autoscale).

## Why Standard Deviation Matters Beyond BigQuery

The same concept is central to **financial forecasting**

- **Low standard deviation** → Stable, forecasting models can use smaller confidence intervals.  
- **High standard deviation** → Volatile, forecasting must include wider error bands.

## Why This Matters to Data Scientists

1. **Beyond averages** → Always check the spread. Averages don’t capture risk.  
2. **Decision making** → Use σ to decide where to commit
3. **Explainability** → Stakeholders understand “volatility” and “consistency” better when you show σ instead of just averages.

## Quick Illustration

Imagine two workloads (or assets):  

- **Workload A / Asset A**: Average = 500, σ = 20 → predictable, low risk.  
- **Workload B / Asset B**: Average = 500, σ = 200 → unstable, high risk.  

Both have the same mean, but **their management strategy must be very different**.  

That’s why standard deviation is a cornerstone metric

# The BigQuery Capacity Conundrum: A Story of Balance

Every organization using BigQuery eventually faces the same puzzle:  
**How do you balance cost and performance when slot usage is so unpredictable?**

Commit too many slots, and you end up paying for idle capacity.  
Rely too much on autoscale, and surprise bills appear when bursts hit.  
The real challenge lies in finding a middle path.

## Step 1: Recognizing Different Workload Behaviors
Not all workloads are alike. Some run with clockwork regularity, consuming a steady number of slots every day. Others stay quiet most of the time, only to surge suddenly and demand far more than expected.

This creates two clear categories:  
- **Stable workloads** → predictable, low variance, good candidates for committed slots.  
- **Bursty workloads** → variable, spiky, better left to autoscale.  

By classifying workloads this way, the decision-making framework starts to emerge.

## Step 2: Defining the Baseline
Once workloads are classified, the next step is to define a **baseline**: the steady capacity that can safely be committed without fear of waste.  

Instead of guessing, organizations often use **percentile-based thresholds**:  
- Baseline commitments around the **60th–70th percentile** of historical usage.  
- Autoscaling to cover **peaks up to the 90th–95th percentile**.  
- Extreme spikes above the 99th percentile are tolerated with autoscale only.  

This ensures the majority of usage is locked in at a discount, while peaks remain flexible.

## Step 3: Handling Bursts
Bursts are where costs can spiral. But not all bursts are created equal.  

- **Short-lived bursts** (minutes or a few hours per year) → keep them on autoscale, since the total cost is negligible.  
- **Sustained bursts** (hundreds or thousands of hours) → these add up quickly and are worth folding into the baseline.  

The key is to measure both **duration** and **frequency**. A burst that happens every day for hours is very different from one that happens once a month for minutes.

## Step 4: Adding Governance
Technology decisions are only half the story — governance makes the system sustainable.  

Policies and rules keep costs predictable without constant human oversight:  
- **Quotas** to prevent runaway queries.  
- **Idle slot alerts** to reassign unused capacity across teams.  
- **Materialized views and partitioned tables** to reduce unnecessary data scans.  
- **Scheduled query staggering** to prevent multiple heavy jobs from clashing at the same time.  

These rules make sure commitments and autoscale remain aligned with actual behavior.

---

## Step 5: Forecasting for Growth
Capacity isn’t static. Data pipelines expand, new use cases appear, and demand grows steadily over time.  

Using **time-series forecasting**, organizations can project future slot demand and adjust commitments accordingly. Adding a **10–20% buffer** for new workloads keeps the system resilient without overcommitting.  

Regular reviews — every quarter or even monthly — ensure that baseline commitments evolve with usage.

---

## Step 6: Translating into Economics
At the end of the day, this all comes down to cost.  

- Committed slots: up to **40% cheaper** with 3-year agreements.  
- Autoscale: more expensive per slot-hour, but only billed when needed.  
- Extreme spikes: absorbed flexibly, ensuring no performance trade-offs.  

This balance gives finance predictable budgets while giving engineering the elasticity to handle any workload.

## The Outcome
By following this journey, organizations transform BigQuery capacity management from guesswork into a **structured, rule-based system**:  

- **Stable workloads** → covered by commitments.  
- **Bursty workloads** → absorbed by autoscale.  
- **Governance** → ensures no one workload can upset the balance.  
- **Forecasting** → keeps the strategy future-proof.  

The result?  
**Predictable costs, reliable performance, and a platform that scales smoothly with the business.**

This is where **FinOps meets engineering** — turning a conundrum into a framework for growth.
